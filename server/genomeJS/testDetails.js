      "genosetLongDesc": "Why do some people seem to enjoy Brussels sprouts, while others can't stand them? The answer may be that genetic variation prevents some people from tasting bitter flavors found in certain vegetables. About 25% of people are unable to taste a chemical called propylthiouracil (PROP) similar to the bitter components found in cabbage, raw broccoli, coffee, tonic water, and dark beers. These people are essentially 'taste-blind'—and compared to those who do respond to PROP, taste-blind people find most food and drink to be less bitter, or not bitter at all. It turns out that sensitivity to this kind of taste is due almost entirely to a single gene that encodes receptors in taste buds on the tongue. A SNP in this gene is responsible for whether a person is bitter taste-blind.",

      "genosetLongDesc":  "Can you imagine what it might feel like to eat food and yet get no energy from it? People with type 1 diabetes undergo something like this. In order to absorb sugars released from food into the bloodstream, your cells need the help of a hormone called insulin. Type 1 diabetes mellitus occurs when the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the body's own immune system. Without these pancreatic cells, sugars build up in the bloodstream. Over time this sugar buildup can result in damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and blood vessels. As many as 3 million people in the United States have type 1 diabetes.",

Genes determine between 20-80% of the variation in traits like oxygen intake, cardiac performance, and muscle fiber composition. To date, more than 150 genes have been linked to different aspects of physical performance. One of the clearest associations is seen with a gene called ACTN3 that is normally turned on in a type of muscle fiber used for power-based sports. A single SNP can turn this gene off. While this genetic change does not cause any health effects, it may contribute to whether you are a sprinter or a marathoner.",

In addition, some males are born 46XX due to the translocation of a tiny section of the sex determining region of the Y chromosome. Similarly some females are also born 46XY due to mutations in the Y chromosome. Clearly, there are not only females who are XX and males who are XY, but rather, there is a range of chromosome complements, hormone balances, and phenotypic variations that determine sex.",

Sickle cell anemia mainly affects people whose ancestors lived in Africa, the Mediterranean, India, or the Middle East within the last thousand years.

The trouble comes from the milk sugar lactose, which is broken down in the body by the enzyme lactase. Normally, the LCT gene, which encodes lactase, is turned on only for the first few years of a mammal's life. After this, the enzyme level decreases and with it the ability to digest large quantities of milk. But some people produce lactase throughout their life and can drink milk without uncomfortable side effects. In different populations across the globe, the local prevalence of the lactase persistent phenotype varies widely—between 0 and 100%. A SNP near the LCT gene controls whether the lactase enzyme is turned on or off as a person grows older.",
