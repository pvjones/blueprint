      "genosetLongDesc": "Why do some people seem to enjoy Brussels sprouts, while others can't stand them? The answer may be that genetic variation prevents some people from tasting bitter flavors found in certain vegetables. About 25% of people are unable to taste a chemical called propylthiouracil (PROP) similar to the bitter components found in cabbage, raw broccoli, coffee, tonic water, and dark beers. These people are essentially 'taste-blind'—and compared to those who do respond to PROP, taste-blind people find most food and drink to be less bitter, or not bitter at all. It turns out that sensitivity to this kind of taste is due almost entirely to a single gene that encodes receptors in taste buds on the tongue. A SNP in this gene is responsible for whether a person is bitter taste-blind.",

Type 1 diabetes mellitus occurs when the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the body's own immune system. Without these pancreatic cells, sugars build up in the bloodstream. Over time this sugar buildup can result in damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and blood vessels. As many as 3 million people in the United States have type 1 diabetes.",

One of the clearest associations is seen with a gene called ACTN3 that is normally turned on in a type of muscle fiber used for power-based sports. A single SNP can turn this gene off.

In addition, some males are born 46XX due to the translocation of a tiny section of the sex determining region of the Y chromosome. Similarly some females are also born 46XY due to mutations in the Y chromosome.

After this, the enzyme level decreases and with it the ability to digest large quantities of milk. But some people produce lactase throughout their life and can drink milk without uncomfortable side effects. In different populations across the globe, the local prevalence of the lactase persistent phenotype varies widely—between 0 and 100%.

Although basal cell carcinomas tend not to metastasize like more serious skin cancers, they can still invade and destroy adjacent and underlying tissue, and must be treated to prevent permanent damage. Sun exposure, having light skin, hair, or eyes, or being over 50 years old are known risk factors to developing basal cell carcinomas. People who have had one basal cell carcinoma are likely to develop additional ones within five years, so continued monitoring is necessary.",

      "genosetLongDesc": "Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a metabolic disorder caused by genetic mutations that inhibit the breakdown of certain amino acids. The disease takes its name from the sweet smell that the amino acid buildup imparts to the urine and earwax of children born with MSUD. Left untreated this disease can lead to coma and death in newborns. But with careful dietary management, people with MSUD can lead relatively normal lives. Mutations in several genes can cause MSUD. Type 1B is caused by mutations in the BCKDHB gene and is inherited in a recessive manner, meaning that only a child who receives two mutated copies of the BCKDHB gene (one from each parent) will get the disease. Although anyone can be a carrier for a mutation that causes MSUD type 1B, mutations causing this disorder are especially common in people with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.",

      "genosetTitle": "Tay-Sachs Disease",
      "genosetLongDesc": "Tay-Sachs disease is caused by mutations in the HEXA gene, which encodes a subunit of the hexosaminidase A enzyme (HEXA). These mutations lead to loss of enzyme activity and a nerve cell-destroying accumulation of a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside in the brain. Different mutations in the HEXA gene cause different forms of Tay-Sachs. The classic infantile form of the disease is characterized by progressive degeneration that results in death between the ages of two and four years. Juvenile Tay-Sachs exhibits a more protracted clinical course with later onset and death usually occurring by age 15. The adult-onset form of Tay-Sachs can cause a variety of neuromuscular and psychiatric symptoms, and does not always lead to a shortened lifespan. Tay-Sachs disease is inherited in a recessive manner, meaning that only a child who receives two mutated copies of the HEXA gene (one from each parent) will get the disease. In general, about one out of every 300 people is a carrier for a Tay-Sachs mutation, but some ethnic groups, including Ashkenazi Jews, French Canadians, Louisiana Cajuns and Irish people, have higher rates",
